SPLIT OF WORK

Following are modules whose functionality is described, please write a function to achieve the functionality.
Save the function definition in a file, named, 'module_no.c' and function definition in a text file named 'module_no_def.txt'
Please provide adequate comments and documentation for efficient debugging and usage.

Modules

1. Supreeth
The box: Write a function, that takes in the dimensions of a 2-D  character array and sets the array to look like a bounded box
           Ex: 0000000000
               0        0
               0        0
               0        0
               0000000000
            Parameters: l,b: The dimension if the rectangular matrix of length l and breadth b.
                        p[][]: The matrix
            Note: function must not display box, but just seth the 2-D array to look like a bounded box. Funtion to display box included too.
                      To set box - boxInit(int l, int b, char p[][]) 
                      To display box - displayBox(int l, int b, char p[][])
                      main funtion included for debugging.
2. Supreeth
Draw the snake: Write a function, that takes in an array of positions(of the snake body), position of the food, the 2-D box array, and plots the snake on the board. 
                    Note: Remember to erase the board each time you draw the new position. 
3. Supreeth
Food generator: Write a function that randomly comes up with a position on the board for the food to appear
                    Parameters: int p[]--[array in which the x,y position will be stored after predicting
4. Collision detection: Write a function that take in an array of positions of the snake body, and returns 1, if it collides(overlaps) with the boundary or itself, else it returns 0
                    Parameters: int p[][] 
5. Clear terminal: Write a function, that clear the windows/linux terminal
                    Note: The required libraries must be mentioned and imported, the function must work both on linux terminal and Windows command prompt.

6. Move snake: Write a function that takes in a number [1,2,3,4], and moves the body of the snake accordingly.
                      Parameters: int n, int p[][], int direction, int board[][]

Information about structure of program (as of now):
    1. Start screen
    2. Game screen
    3. End credit screen
    Detailed version: 1. Start screen: Displays Title, and ASCII logo, press Q to quit, S to see leaderboard, and C to continue to the game
                                       Take in the Name of the user, press Enter'
                      2. Game screen: Use starts with 0 score and 3 lives, after 3 lives, goto end credit screen.
                      3. End credit screen: Thank you,
                                            Show the user's score, Show the leaderboard, Press Q to quit, R to try again.
